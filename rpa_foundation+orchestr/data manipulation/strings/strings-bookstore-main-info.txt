--Activities and Methods used
We started the project as a Sequence and used an Assign for the initial value 
of the “message” String variable: "You searched for author Mark Twain. 
His books can be found in the following stores: Bookland, Classics bookstore."

We created a new String variable (“author”) and used a succession 
of String methods to assign the author from the query: 
message.Split("."c).First.ToString.Substring(message.LastIndexOf("author")):

v Split("."c).First.ToString extracts the first sentence of the String 
and converts it to a String;

v Substring(message.LastIndexOf("author")) extracts the Substring that is after “author”;

We created a new List variable (“bookstores”) and used a succession of String methods 
to assign the bookstores from the query: message.Split("."c)(1).ToString.Split(":"c).Last.ToString.Split(","c).ToList

v message.Split("."c)(1).ToString extracts the second sentence of the String and converts it to a String;

v Split(":"c).Last.ToString splits the remaining String and keeps only the last part of it;

v Split(","c).ToList takes each string separated by comma and adds it as an element in the List variable;

We created a new String variable to display the values of the 2 variables: 
String.Format("Availability for {0}: {1}", author ,String.Join(";"+vbCr,bookstores)). 

In this expression, String.Join is used to extract each element in the “bookstores” 
List variable and display them. vbCr is used to go on a new row for each element (similar to Environment.NewLine)
