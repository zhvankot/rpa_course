-- The type of automation project

There are 4 predefined types of workflows – 
Sequence, 
Flowchart, 
State Machine 
and Global Exception Handler.

We are covering them in depth in the “Project Organization” course, 
for now let’s focus on the difference between sequences and flowcharts, 
as we will use both extensively in our examples throughout the entire course.

-> In sequences, the process steps flow in a clear succession. Decision trees are rarely used. 
Activities in sequences are easier to read and maintain, thus, they are highly recommended 
for simple, linear workflows.

-> In flowcharts, the individual activities are a bit more difficult to read and edit, but 
the flows between them are much clearer. Use flowcharts when decision points and 
branching are needed in order to accommodate complex scenarios, 
workarounds and decision mechanisms.
