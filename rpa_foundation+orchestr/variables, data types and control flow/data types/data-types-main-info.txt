-- The GenericValue 
(UiPath.Core.GenericValue) 
variable is a type of variable particular to UiPath 
that can store any kind of data, including text, 
numbers, dates, and arrays.

UiPath Studio has an automatic conversion mechanism 
of GenericValue variables, which you can guide towards 
the desired outcome by carefully defining their expressions. 

Please note that the first element in your expression is used 
as a guideline for what operation Studio performs. 

For example, when you try to add two GenericValue variables, if the first one 
in the expression is defined as a String, the result is the concatenation 
of the two. If it is defined as an Integer, the result is their sum.

--What are some business scenarios in which I will use GenericValue variables?

Data is extracted from a UI field and forwarded to another workflow without processing

Two versions of the same Excel file are being compared column by column. The columns 
are different in terms of data type, the only relevant thing is which entries have changes 


--The control flow statements

The activities and methods used to define the decisions to be made during the execution 
of a workflow. The most common control flow statements are the if/else decision, 
the loops and the switch. Let's focus on them one by one.
